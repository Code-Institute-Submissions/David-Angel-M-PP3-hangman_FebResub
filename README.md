I want the game to have higher difficulty.
I want to easily understand the main purpose of the game.
I want ramdon choices of words (10000).
I want to be able to see how many attemps I have left.
I want the option to play again.

FEATURES

The Features I want the game to have are:

Allow the User to guess a word typing a letter of each underscore displayed on screen.
To give an aspect of difficulty with 7 attempts.
If either game is lost or finished, the User will be presented with a restart game option.
To provide a game where the User guesses a ramdon word among 10000!.
Make sure any User input is validated to prevent improper value input.


This game was created to show my knowledge of Python. The game should be easy and simple to play. The game should be easy to play and to understand the purposed of it.

Game Goals:

To put in practise that I understand the basic skills to used Python. To give users an easy way to understand and easy way to play the game. To give users a good experience to come back and play the game.
