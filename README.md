# PORTFOLIO PROJECT - 3



# HANGMAN



## PURPOSE

Hangman is a guessing game in which players try to guess a word or phrase by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. The game is typically represented by a blanked out word or phrase, with each letter that has been correctly guessed being filled in. If the player makes too many incorrect guesses, a "hangman" drawing, typically a stick figure being hanged, will be partially drawn, eventually leading to a full drawing and loss if all the incorrect guesses used up. It is a popular game often used to teach children spelling and vocabulary.



## FINAL RESULT

https://pp3hangman.herokuapp.com/



## THE MAIN IDEA

My initial idea for the project was to create a game that we all know as is been around for a long time and is very fun to play, simple and easy using all the information learned throughout the material of Python. 

### The Features I wanted the project to have are:

To make the game easy to play. Have an easy understanding how to play and to keep it as simple as possible.



## AS A USER 

* I want the game to have higher difficulty.
* I want to easily understand the main purpose of the game.
* I want random choices of words (10000).
* I want to be able to see how many attemps I have left.
* I want the option to play again.



## FEATURES

### The Features I want the game to have are:

* Allow the User to guess a word typing a letter of each underscore displayed on screen.
* To give an aspect of difficulty with 7 attempts.
* If either game is lost or finished, the User will be presented with a restart game option.
* To provide a game where the User guesses a ramdon word among 10000!.
* Make sure any User input is validated to prevent improper value input.
* Numbers and symbols would be consider as failed attemp.




### Game Goals:

To put in practise that I understand the basic skills to used Python. To give users an easy way to understand and easy way to play the game. To give users a good experience to come back and play the game.

## TESTING

The game has been tested in the terminal with the "pip install black" command.



## VALIDATORS

The game has been validated in the CI Python Linter.

## SOLVED BUGS AND ERRORS

Corrected variables from camelCase to lowerCase with low_dash
Mainly space and indentation errors



## UNSOLVED BUGS AND ERRORS

* I encounter 3 warning errors in gitpod.yml
* I encounter 2 warning errors in run.py
* I encounter 13 blue (i) in run.py



## FUNCTIONALITY

The game has been tested, played and has responded correctly.



## TECHNOLOGIES USED

* This project was made using only Python.
* Code is written in Gitpod.
* This project has been deployed to HEROKU.



## USING THE HEROKU APP FOR DEPLOYMENT

* I started with creating a Config Var called PORT and set this to 8000 in my Heroku page.

### I Created The App Using Following Steps:

* I added two buildpacks from the settings tab. 

### The Ordering Is As Follows:

* heroku/python
* heroku/nodejs



## PROGRAMS USED

* GIT for version control.
* Commiting and pushing to Github. 
* Github used to store repositories.
* Files and images pushed from Gitpod.
